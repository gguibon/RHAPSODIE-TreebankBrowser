A graphical interface that allows you to manage members of a team, see charts about their distribution per supervisors, entry date, etc. It allows you to obtain a trombinoscope of the members, and to filter your data.

The actual version is 1.8.0.

It is a evolution of this tutorial[this tutorial from code.makery](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/ "code.makery tutorial") with several additionnal features:
- edit photo
- edit double click to edit
